In JavaScript, resolve and reject are functions passed as parameters to the
executor function within a Promise constructor. They are crucial for managing
the state of a Promise and signaling its completion or failure. 

Significance of resolve and reject:

- resolve(value):
When a promise is successfully fulfilled, the resolve function is called with a
value (the result of the operation). This transitions the promise from its
pending state to the fulfilled state, making the value available to the .then()
handler.

- reject(error):
When a promise encounters an error or cannot be completed successfully, the
reject function is called with an error object (or a reason for failure). This
transitions the promise from its pending state to the rejected state, making
the error available to the .catch() handler or the second argument of .then(). 

In essence, resolve and reject:

Control the Promise's state:
They determine whether the promise becomes resolved (fulfilled) or rejected
(failed).

Communicate results:
They pass the outcome of the asynchronous operation (success or failure) to the
promise's consumers.

Enable chaining and error handling:
The .then() and .catch() methods rely on the resolve and reject calls to
determine which handler to execute.
