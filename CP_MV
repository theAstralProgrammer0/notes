You can use the brace expansion feature `{,.}` in combination with the `mv` or
`cp` command to copy a file and change its extension in the same line. Here's
how you can do it:

```bash
mv /path/to/source/file.{old_extension,new_extension}
```

or

```bash
cp /path/to/source/file.{old_extension,new_extension}
```

Replace `/path/to/source/file` with the path to the source file you want to
copy, `old_extension` with the current extension of the file, and
`new_extension` with the desired extension you want to change to.

For example, if you have a file named `example.txt` and you want to copy it and
change its extension to `.bak`, you can use:

```bash
cp /path/to/example.txt{,.bak}
```

This will copy `example.txt` to `example.txt.bak` in the same directory.
