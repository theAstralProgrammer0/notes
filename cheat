- cat /etc/passwd: The /etc/passwd file contains a list of all user accounts on
		   the system, along with some basic information about each account.

- getent passwd: This command fetches entries from databases configured in
		 /etc/nsswitch.conf, which includes the local /etc/passwd file
		 as well as other sources such as LDAP.

- cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd: This command extracts just the usernames from the
			   /etc/passwd file using the cut command, which cuts
			   sections from each line of files.

- awk -F: '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd: Similar to the cut command, this awk
				      command prints the first field (username)
				      from each line of the /etc/passwd file.			   

- getent passwd <username>: To find the home directory of a user in a Linux
			    machine, you can use the getent command followed by
			    the username.				      

- getent passwd <username> | awk -F: '{print $6}': You can directly extract the
						   home directory of a user
						   using commands like grep or
						   awk			    

- pgrep nginx: You can use the pgrep command to find the PID (Process ID) of a
	       process by its name. This command will output the PID(s) of the
	       processes matching the specified name.

- pgrep -o nginx: If you want to get the main PID (the first PID in the list),
		  you can use pgrep with the -o option to only display the
		  oldest PID
