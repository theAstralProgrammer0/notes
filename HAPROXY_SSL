When creating an SSL certificate for HAProxy load balancer SSL termination, the
containing folder where the SSL certificate files reside can be on the server
filesystem or on a local filesystem, depending on your setup and requirements.

If you're generating the SSL certificate directly on the server where HAProxy
is running, you can choose to store the SSL certificate files in a directory on
the server filesystem.

Alternatively, if you generate the SSL certificate on a separate machine or
environment, you can transfer the certificate files to the server where HAProxy
is running and store them in a directory on the server filesystem.

Once the SSL certificate files are in the designated directory on the server,
     HAProxy can access them for SSL termination. HAProxy typically requires
     two main SSL certificate files:

1. **Certificate file (.crt)**: This file contains the SSL certificate issued by the Certificate Authority (CA).
2. **Private key file (.key)**: This file contains the private key associated with the SSL certificate.

To configure HAProxy for SSL termination, you typically specify the paths to
these certificate files in the HAProxy configuration file. Here's an example of
how you might configure HAProxy to perform SSL termination using the
certificate files stored in a specific directory:

```bash
frontend my_frontend
    bind *:443 ssl crt /path/to/certificate/directory/certificate.crt
    # Specify the private key file
    # bind *:443 ssl crt /path/to/certificate/directory/certificate.pem
    # Alternatively, you can combine the certificate and private key into a single file:
    # bind *:443 ssl crt /path/to/certificate/directory/certificate.pem
    # Specify other frontend configurations as needed
```

In this configuration:

- `bind *:443` binds HAProxy to port 443 for HTTPS traffic.
- `ssl` indicates that SSL/TLS termination is enabled.
- `crt /path/to/certificate/directory/certificate.crt` specifies the path to the SSL certificate file.

You can also specify additional options and configurations in the HAProxy
frontend to customize SSL termination behavior, such as enabling SSL
offloading, configuring SSL cipher suites, enabling HSTS, and more, depending
on your requirements and security best practices.
