When resolve() is called without arguments in a Promise, it returns a resolved
Promise with a value of undefined. Similarly, when reject() is called without
arguments, it returns a rejected Promise with a value of undefined. These
values are not directly passed to the then or catch chains. Instead, then is
called with undefined as the resolved value, and catch is called with undefined
as the rejected value. 

Detailed Explanation:

- resolve() with no arguments:
When resolve() is called without a value, it implicitly resolves the Promise
with the value undefined. 
The then method's callback will be executed with undefined as the argument if
no error has occurred before the resolve() call. 

- reject() with no arguments:
When reject() is called without a value, it implicitly rejects the Promise with
the value undefined. 
The catch method's callback will be executed with undefined as the argument. 

Accessing the values in then and catch chains:

- then chain:
The then method takes two optional arguments: a success callback and a failure
callback (or error handler). 
When a Promise is resolved, the success callback is executed. If the resolve()
was called with a value, that value is passed as an argument to the success
callback. 
If resolve() was called without a value, the success callback receives
undefined. 

- catch chain:
The catch method is a shorthand for then(null, onRejected) and is used to
handle errors (rejections) of a Promise. 
When a Promise is rejected, the error handler (or catch's callback) is
executed. If the reject() was called with a value, that value (usually an error
object) is passed as an argument to the error handler. 
If reject() was called without a value, the error handler receives undefined. 

Example:

```js

let promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Resolve without a value
  resolve();
});

promise1.then(
  (value) => {
    console.log("Resolved with:", value); // Output: Resolved with: undefined
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("Rejected with:", error);
  }
);

let promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Reject without a value
  reject();
});

promise2.catch(
    (error) => {
        console.log("Rejected with:", error); // Output: Rejected with: undefined
    }
)

let promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Resolve with a value
    resolve("Success!");
  });

  promise3.then(
    (value) => {
      console.log("Resolved with:", value); // Output: Resolved with: Success!
    },
    (error) => {
      console.log("Rejected with:", error);
    }
  );

```
