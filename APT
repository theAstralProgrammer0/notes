To check the list of installed packages on your Linux system, you can use
package management commands such as `dpkg` or `apt` on Debian-based systems
like Ubuntu. Here's how you can do it:

1. Using `dpkg`:
   ```bash
   dpkg --get-selections
   ```

2. Using `apt`:
   ```bash
   apt list --installed
   ```

To check the list of available packages that can be installed, you can use the
following command:

```bash
apt list
```

This command will list all available packages along with their versions. You
can also use `apt-cache` to search for specific packages:

```bash
apt-cache search <package_name>
```

Replace `<package_name>` with the name or keyword of the package you're looking
for. This will display a list of packages matching the search criteria.
