Here's how to capture a signal from standard input and perform an operation
once detected in a Python script:

```Python

import signal
import sys

def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    print('Signal detected:', sig)
    # Perform your desired operation here
    print('Performing operation...')
    sys.exit(0)

# Register the signal handler for specific signals
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler) # Handles Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
# signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)  #Handles termination signal
# signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, signal_handler) #Handles hang up signal

print('Program running. Press Ctrl+C to trigger the signal.')

while True:
    try:
        # Keep the program running until a signal is received
        pass
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # Handle KeyboardInterrupt if signal.signal is not used
        signal_handler(signal.SIGINT, None)

```

This script sets up a signal handler that listens for SIGINT (triggered by
Ctrl+C). When the signal is detected, the signal_handler function is executed,
printing a message and performing a specified operation before exiting. Other
signals like SIGTERM (termination signal) and SIGHUP (hang up signal) can be
handled similarly.
