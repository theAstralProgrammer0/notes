%Cpu(s):  0.1 us,  0.2 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
		  
	This section of the `top` feedback output provides information about CPU usage. Here's a breakdown of each component:

	- `%Cpu(s)`: This indicates the percentage of CPU time spent in various states.

	- `0.1 us`: This represents the percentage of CPU time spent by user-level processes.

	- `0.2 sy`: This indicates the percentage of CPU time spent by system-level processes.

	- `0.0 ni`: This shows the percentage of CPU time spent by processes with a positive nice value, which are user tasks that have been niced (i.e., their priority has been lowered).

	- `99.7 id`: This represents the percentage of CPU time spent idle, meaning the CPU is not executing any tasks.

	- `0.0 wa`: This indicates the percentage of CPU time spent waiting for I/O operations to complete.

	- `0.0 hi`: This shows the percentage of CPU time spent handling hardware interrupts.

	- `0.0 si`: This represents the percentage of CPU time spent handling software interrupts.

	- `0.0 st`: This indicates the percentage of CPU time stolen from a virtual machine by the hypervisor. This is relevant in virtualized environments.

	In summary, this section provides a snapshot of how the CPU is being utilized across different types of tasks and operations.

These sections provide information about memory usage on a system:

1. **EiB Mem**:
   - **0.0 total**: Total physical memory available on the system, measured in exbibytes (EiB).
		    An exbibyte is a unit of digital information storage equivalent to 2^60 bytes.
   - **0.0 free**: Amount of free memory in exbibytes.
   - **0.0 used**: Amount of memory in use, including both actively used memory and memory used for buffers/cache.
   - **0.0 buff/cache**: Amount of memory used for buffer/cache, which can be reclaimed if needed by applications.

2. **EiB Swap**:
   - **0.0 total**: Total swap space available on the system, measured in exbibytes.
   - **0.0 free**: Amount of free swap space in exbibytes.
   - **0.0 used**: Amount of swap space in use.
   - **0.0 avail Mem**: Available memory for allocation by programs, calculated based on total memory and memory currently used for buffers/cache.

These sections provide a summary of the system's memory usage, including physical memory (RAM) and swap space.
The values are presented in exbibytes, a unit of digital information storage commonly used in computing.
