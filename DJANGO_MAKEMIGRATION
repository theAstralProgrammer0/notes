To create migrations in Django, follow these steps:

Modify your models:
Make the necessary changes to your models in the models.py file of your app.
This could involve adding new models, modifying existing ones, or deleting
models.

Run makemigrations:
Open your terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (where
manage.py is located). Then, run the following command:

Code

    python manage.py makemigrations

This command will scan your models for changes and create new migration files
in the migrations directory of your app. If you want to create migrations for a
specific app, you can specify the app name:

Code

    python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>

Review the migration files:
It's a good practice to review the generated migration files before applying
them. These files are located in the migrations directory of your app and
contain the instructions for modifying your database schema.

Apply the migrations:
To apply the migrations and update your database schema, run the following
command:

Code

    python manage.py migrate

This command will execute all pending migrations, including the ones you just
created. If you want to apply migrations for a specific app, you can specify
the app name:

Code

    python manage.py migrate <app_name>

These steps should be repeated every time the models are changed.
