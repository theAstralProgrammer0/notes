`/dev/sdc` is a block device typically representing a physical disk or a partition on a disk in Linux systems.
When you see `/dev/sdc` in the output of `df` (disk free), it means that there is a filesystem mounted on that device or partition.

If `df` is showing a filesystem with a size of 1007GB on `/dev/sdc`,
it indicates that there is a storage device connected to your system with a capacity of 1007GB,
and it has been mounted or is being recognized by your system.
This device could be a separate hard disk, a USB drive, or some other type of storage device.

The fact that it shows more capacity than your internal solid-state drive (SSD) suggests that `/dev/sdc` may be an external storage device,
or it could be a partition on your internal drive that is not being used by your operating system.
You can use tools like `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` to get more detailed information about your storage devices and their partitions.
