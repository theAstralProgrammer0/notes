In Bash, you can use a few different commands to display properties of a file or directory, such as size, extension, modification time, etc. Here are the most commonly used methods:

### 1. **Using `ls -l`**
The `ls -l` command lists detailed information about files and directories:
```bash
ls -l /path/to/file_or_directory
```

Output example:
```
-rw-r--r--  1 user  group   1024 Nov 16 12:34 myfile.txt
```

**Details provided**:
- File permissions (`-rw-r--r--`)
- Number of links (`1`)
- Owner (`user`)
- Group (`group`)
- Size in bytes (`1024`)
- Modification date and time (`Nov 16 12:34`)
- File name (`myfile.txt`)

### 2. **Using `stat`**
The `stat` command provides comprehensive information about a file or directory:
```bash
stat /path/to/file_or_directory
```

Example output:
```
  File: myfile.txt
  Size: 1024       Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: 803h/2051d Inode: 1234567     Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1000/user)   Gid: ( 1000/group)
Access: 2024-11-16 12:34:56.789012345 +0000
Modify: 2024-11-16 12:34:56.789012345 +0000
Change: 2024-11-16 12:34:56.789012345 +0000
 Birth: -
```

**Key properties**:
- Size, blocks, and I/O block size
- File type (e.g., regular file, directory)
- Permissions (both numeric and symbolic)
- User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID)
- Access, modification, and change timestamps

### 3. **Using `file`**
The `file` command determines the file type based on its content:
```bash
file /path/to/file_or_directory
```

Example output:
```
myfile.txt: ASCII text
```

### 4. **Using `du` for Size**
To check the size of a file or directory:
```bash
du -sh /path/to/file_or_directory
```

Output example:
```
1.1M    /path/to/file_or_directory
```

### 5. **Using `find` for Extended Properties**
To display additional properties like file type, size, and permissions:
```bash
find /path/to/file -maxdepth 0 -printf "Name: %f\nSize: %s bytes\nType: %y\nPermissions: %M\n"
```

Example output:
```
Name: myfile.txt
Size: 1024 bytes
Type: f
Permissions: -rw-r--r--
```

### 6. **Using `stat` for Specific Properties**
To get specific properties like size and modification time:
```bash
stat --format="%s bytes, last modified on %y" /path/to/file
```

Output example:
```
1024 bytes, last modified on 2024-11-16 12:34:56.789012345 +0000
```
